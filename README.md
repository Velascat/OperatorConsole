# FOB — Forward Operating Base

A workspace entry tool for Claude-driven development. Run `fob` from any repo — it detects where you are, bootstraps itself if needed, and opens a structured Zellij workspace.

## What You Get

- **`fob`** — smart entrypoint: detects your repo, auto-launches the right workspace
- **Structured workspace** — lazygit, logs, and shell stacked on the left; Claude on the right
- **`.fob/` mission files** — four local markdown files that give Claude explicit, persistent context across sessions
- **Auto-discovery** — every git repo under `~/Documents/GitHub/` appears in the picker automatically; no YAML required

## What Happens When You Run `fob`

1. If your Python environment isn't ready, it bootstraps itself first (first run only)
2. If you're inside a git repo and that tab isn't already open → auto-selects, no picker
3. If that repo's tab is already open → shows picker so you can open a different repo
4. If you're not in a known repo → picker shows all repos under `~/Documents/GitHub/`
5. A named Zellij session opens with a tab per selected repo
6. In each tab: Claude starts with `claude --continue` and reads `.fob/.briefing` for context
7. lazygit, logs, and shell are stacked on the left — focused pane expands, others collapse to a title strip

## Why It Exists

`--continue` in Claude Code resumes the last conversation, but gives Claude no structured context about what was being worked on. `.fob/` provides that — a standing orders doc, an active mission, an objectives list, and a mission log. Claude reads these at startup and picks up exactly where things left off.

## Installation

```bash
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/FOB
./fob install         # symlinks fob to ~/.local/bin (bootstraps Python env automatically)
source ~/.bashrc
fob doctor            # verify dependencies
```

Dependencies: `zellij`, `claude` (Claude Code CLI), `lazygit`, `git`, `python3`, `fzf`

## First Run

```bash
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/YourRepo
fob
```

That's it. The Python environment bootstraps itself on the first invocation. `.fob/` is auto-initialized in the repo if missing.

## `.fob/` Continuity Model

FOB uses a two-layer model to give Claude structured, intentional startup context.

**Source files** — edit these directly:

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `active-mission.md` | Current objective — singular, replace when focus changes |
| `standing-orders.md` | Stable repo policy — branch rules, operating constraints |
| `objectives.md` | Work inventory — in-progress, up-next, done |
| `mission-log.md` | Chronological log — decisions, stop points, what changed |

**Compiled artifact** — generated at launch, do not edit:

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `.briefing` | All four files + runtime context (branch, timestamp, repo) compiled into one startup document |

At launch, FOB regenerates `.fob/.briefing` from the source files. Claude reads the briefing as its primary startup context — one structured entrypoint instead of raw multi-file discovery.

`fob resume` prints the current briefing so you can inspect exactly what Claude will see.

## Commands

**Primary:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `fob` / `fob brief [repo]` | Launch — auto-selects repo from cwd, or shows picker |
| `fob brief --reset-layout` | Regenerate layout from defaults, discarding saved state |
| `fob clear` | Delete saved layout for current repo |
| `fob clear --all` | Delete all saved layouts |
| `fob attach` | Re-attach to the running `fob` session |
| `fob exit` | Kill the `fob` session and all panes |
| `fob init [repo]` | Initialize `.fob/` mission files in a repo |
| `fob resume` | Print current mission brief from `.fob/` |
| `fob status` | Show repo, branch, session, and `.fob/` state |
| `fob test` | Run project tests |
| `fob audit` | Run project audit |
| `fob doctor` | Check and install dependencies |

**Utility:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `fob loadout` | Install and configure dev tools |
| `fob cheat` | Open keybinding reference (floating pane inside Zellij) |
| `fob install` | Symlink `fob` to `~/.local/bin` |

## Profiles (Optional)

Repos are auto-discovered — no YAML needed for basic use. Create `config/profiles/<name>.yaml` to configure custom Claude context files, peer repo awareness, or non-default helper commands.

See [docs/profiles.md](docs/profiles.md).

## Typical Session

```
$ cd ~/Documents/GitHub/VideoFoundry
$ fob
  Brief: VideoFoundry
  → Creating session 'fob'

[Zellij opens — Claude pane starts, reads .fob/, continues from last session]
```
