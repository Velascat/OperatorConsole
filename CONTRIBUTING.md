# Contributing to OperatorConsole

OperatorConsole is a local operator console for Claude-driven development — a Zellij session manager with context-file continuity and an execution pipeline that delegates to OperationsCenter.

## Before You Start

- Check open issues to avoid duplicate work
- For significant changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach
- All contributions must pass the test suite and linter before merging

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProtocolWarden/OperatorConsole.git
cd OperatorConsole
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Dependencies: `zellij`, `lazygit`, `fzf`, `python3 >= 3.11`

## Running Tests

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Running the Linter

```bash
ruff check src/
```

## Project Structure

## What Belongs Here

OperatorConsole is the **operator UX layer only**. It must not contain:
- Planning or proposal logic (belongs in OperationsCenter)
- Routing logic (belongs in SwitchBoard)
- Adapter/execution logic (belongs in OperationsCenter backends)

If you are unsure whether a feature belongs in OperatorConsole, open an issue first.

## Pull Requests

- Keep PRs focused — one concern per PR
- Write or update tests for any changed behavior
- Update relevant docs in `docs/` if the change affects user-facing behavior
- Reference related issues in the PR description

## Commit Style

Use conventional commit prefixes:

| Prefix | Use for |
|--------|---------|
| `feat:` | new user-facing feature |
| `fix:` | bug fix |
| `refactor:` | internal restructure, no behavior change |
| `docs:` | documentation only |
| `test:` | test additions or fixes |
| `chore:` | tooling, CI, dependency updates |
